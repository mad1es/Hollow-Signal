**Text:**
```
GAME OVERVIEW

Platform: iOS (17.0+)
Genre: Psychological Horror / Interactive Experience
Player Count: Single Player
Duration: ~10 minutes per session

Hollow Signal creates a sense of something watching 
the player through their phone's sensors, blurring 
the line between reality and perception.
```

**Design Notes:**

- Option 3: Split image showing "normal" vs "distorted" perception

**Text:**
```
CORE CONCEPT

Sensory Desynchronization
A rare neurological condition where the brain 
incorrectly processes sensory information.

The app documents these anomalies in real-time, 
creating a sense that something is watching 
the player—not through the screen, but through 
the player themselves.
```

**Design Notes:**
- Dark, mysterious aesthetic
- Visual metaphor for the concept
- Text should be clear and readable
- Use icons or simple graphics to illustrate concept

---

## SLIDE 4: Storyline & Narrative

**Visual:**
- Timeline visualization (horizontal or vertical)
- Key events marked along the timeline
- Dark background with white/light gray timeline
- Small icons or images for each phase

**Text:**
```
STORYLINE & NARRATIVE

2019: Neuroscientists discover "Sensory Desynchronization"
2020: Prototype app developed for documentation
2021: Research discontinued (ethical concerns)
2022: App lost, copies spread

The player launches an app that supposedly documents 
real neurological anomalies. But the longer they use it, 
the more it seems to know about them...
```

**Design Notes:**
- Timeline should be visually clear
- Use different colors or sizes for different phases
- Include small visual elements (icons, symbols)
- Keep text concise - expand verbally

---

## SLIDE 5: Key Events Timeline

**Visual:**
- Vertical timeline with 8 phases
- Each phase shown as a box or card
- Time markers (0:00, 0:05, 0:30, etc.)
- Visual progression from light to dark (tension building)

**Text:**
```
KEY EVENTS - 10 MINUTE EXPERIENCE

0:00-0:05  Loading: "wait..."
0:05-0:30  First Contact: "Are you there?"
0:30-1:30  Establishing Contact: Voice analysis
1:30-3:00  Observations: "You're tired", "You're tense"
3:00-5:00  First Task: "Tell me what you see"
5:00-7:00  Deepening: "Come closer"
7:00-10:00 Anomalies: Echo, predictions, sync
10:00+     Conclusion: "I'm in you"
```

**Design Notes:**
- Visual timeline is crucial here
- Use color gradient (light → dark) to show tension
- Each phase can have a small icon or symbol
- Make it scannable and easy to follow

```
GAMEPLAY PROCESS

1. App displays text (short phrases)
2. Player reacts (voice, movement, touch, silence)
3. Sensors analyze player actions
4. LLM generates response
5. App displays reaction
6. Loop repeats, tension builds

No buttons, no menus—only text and presence.
```

**Design Notes:**
- Clear flowchart is essential
- Use consistent icons/symbols
- Show the circular nature of the loop
- Include actual interface screenshot if possible

---

## SLIDE 7: Player-System Interaction Diagram

**Visual:**

**Text:**
```
HOW IT WORKS

Player Actions → Phone Sensors → Analysis System → 
LLM Service → "The Hollow" → Screen Display

Real-time analysis of:
• Voice (speech recognition, emotion)
• Movement (gyroscope, accelerometer)
• Proximity (distance to face)
• Breathing (microphone analysis)
```

**Design Notes:**
- This is a technical slide - make it clear

```
GAME MECHANICS

VOICE INTERACTION
Player speaks → App recognizes → Generates response

MOVEMENT TRACKING
Phone movement → Analyzed → Subtle reactions

PROXIMITY SENSOR
Distance to face → Creates intimacy → Tension

SILENCE DETECTION
No input → App comments → Psychological pressure

NO TRADITIONAL CONTROLS
Minimalistic interface—only text and presence
```

**Design Notes:**
- Use icons for each mechanic
- Show visual examples
- Keep descriptions short
- Make it scannable

---

## SLIDE 9: Objectives & Goals

**Visual:**
- Central objective in large text
- Side objectives in smaller boxes/cards

```
OBJECTIVES

MAIN OBJECTIVE
Experience the full 10-minute journey
(No traditional "win" or "lose")

SIDE OBJECTIVES
• Explore all reactions
• Understand the mechanics
• Don't close the app from fear
• Replay for different LLM responses

The goal: Understand what's happening
```

**Design Notes:**
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Main objective should stand out
- Side objectives can be in smaller boxes
- Use icons or symbols

---

## SLIDE 10: Possible Endings

**Visual:**

**Text:**
```
POSSIBLE ENDINGS

ENDING 1: "Full Awareness"
Complete all phases → "I'm in you. And you know it."
App goes to background, continues "existing"

ENDING 2: "Escape"
Close app early → "You returned. I knew you would."
Game "remembers" on next launch

ENDING 3: "Synchronization"
Multiple playthroughs → Game "learns" player behavior
Becomes more accurate in predictions
```

**Design Notes:**
- Three distinct visual styles for each ending
